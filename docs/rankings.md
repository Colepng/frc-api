# Rankings

Here is an example of how you would set your default values 

```python
ranking = FrcWrapper.Rankings(season=2022, team_number=865, District="ONT")
```

Default values are used when in you dont specify a value for a parameter in a function. If you dont specify a value for season the current season is used.

The District parameter is what you want your default district to be.
